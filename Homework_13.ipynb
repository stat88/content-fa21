    "**b)** Find $E(\\hat{Y})$. In Data 8 language, this is the average of the fitted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** The difference $Y - \\hat{Y}$ is called a *residual*. It is the difference between the actual and fitted values of $Y$. Find the expectation of the residual and confirm that the answer justifies the following statement [from Data 8](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/15/6/Numerical_Diagnostics.html#Average-of-Residuals):\n",
